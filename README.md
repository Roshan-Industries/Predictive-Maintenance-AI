# Predictive-Maintenance-AI
AI-powered predictive maintenance system for industrial machinery, utilizing machine learning and IoT sensors to predict failures before they happen. Features include real-time data collection, failure pattern detection, proactive alerts, and cloud-based analytics to reduce downtime and optimize maintenance efficiency.

This project aims to develop an AI-powered predictive maintenance system for industrial machinery, leveraging machine learning algorithms and IoT sensor data to predict potential equipment failures before they occur. By analyzing real-time data such as temperature, vibration, and pressure, the system can identify patterns that indicate when maintenance is needed, helping businesses reduce downtime, minimize repair costs, and improve overall operational efficiency.

Key Features:

Real-time data collection from IoT sensors.
Machine learning models to detect failure patterns.
Predictive alerts for proactive maintenance scheduling.
Cloud-based analytics and dashboard for monitoring and reporting.
Technologies Used:

Python (for machine learning and data analysis).
TensorFlow/Keras (for building predictive models).
IoT integration (for sensor data collection).
Cloud computing (for data storage and analytics).
Installation & Setup: Instructions for setting up the project locally, along with dependencies and environment configurations, will be provided.
